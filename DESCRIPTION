Description: R Client for the Spotify Web API. As of spotifyr version 0.5 a 
    subset of the API is available, but should grow quickly. 
    API entry points with for the verb GET are wrapped. All the low-level 
    wrapper functions starting with the prefix 'i_' are exported but 
    this is a transient state of affair: users should preferably use other package 
    function unless experimenting or developing the package.
